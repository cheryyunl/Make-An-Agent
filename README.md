This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of **Make-An-Agent**. **Make-An-Agent**, a policy parameter generator that leverages the power of conditional diffusion models for behavior-to-policy generation, which demonstrates remarkable versatility and scalability on multiple tasks and has a strong generalization ability on unseen tasks to output well-performed policies with only few-shot demonstrations as inputs.

# üíª Installation
1. create a virtual environment and install all required packages. 
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml 
conda activate makeagent
```

2. install Metaworld and mujoco_py for evaluations.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml 
conda activate makeagent
```


## üõ†Ô∏è Code Usage
If you would like to run DrM on [DeepMind Control Suite](https://github.com/google-deepmind/dm_control), please use train_dmc.py to train DrM policies on different configs.

```bash
python train_dmc.py task=dog_walk agent=drm
```

If you would like to run DrM on [MetaWorld](https://meta-world.github.io/), please use train_mw.py to train DrM policies on different configs.

```bash
python train_mw.py task=coffee-push agent=drm_mw
python train_mw.py task=disassemble agent=drm_mw
```

If you would like to run DrM on Adroit, please use train_adroit.py to train DrM policies on different configs.

```bash
python train_adroit.py task=pen agent=drm_adroit
```
